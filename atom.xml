    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Version 0.4 of node-pdfutils is a complete rewrite of pdfutils.</p>
<p>The old design didn’t work out, I naively decided that it would be a<br>good idea to do as much as possible in C++ and keep the JS side minimal<br>in order to reduce context switches between JS and C++. Turns out this was<br>a bad idea. First of all, node will switch to a new v8-API with 0.12. This<br>means I have to rewrite big parts of the code once 0.12 is out. Furthermore<br>it turns out (surprise!) that the C++-part became messy and was harder to<br>maintain. With the new architecture, I keep the C++ smaller and better<br>structured. Also I kept in mind that the v8-API will change and it’ll be easy<br>to switch to the new one.</p>
<p>One of the most requested features is reordering/insert/extract<br>pages from/to a document. With this rewrite, we finally got a base<br>to do this. It’s not implemented yet, but it’s much easier to do now.</p>
<p>Also I’m proud to announce, that pdfutils will support multiple PDF-engines.</p>
<p>The 0.4 series will switch license: node-pdfutils was licensed under GPL before,<br>which makes it hard to include it with 3rd party products. 0.4 will be dual<br>licensed under MIT/GPL. The idea is, that you can choose to use MIT with any<br>GPL-free PDF-engine. If you want to use i.e. poppler, you have to use GPL, as<br>poppler is GPL itself (If I’m talking nonsense, please correct me.)</p>
